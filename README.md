# K-Means Clustering for image-data 

## Description
This project, developed by Ali Akbar Ahrari, is an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using linear algebra concepts. It processes images and applies K-Means clustering to categorize data and update cluster centers. The project is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as NumPy and PIL.

## Features
- Image Processing: Processes images into arrays using PIL and NumPy.
- K-Means Clustering: Applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize data and update cluster centers.
- Image Saving: Saves the centroids of the clusters as images.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PIL

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k-means-clustering.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd k-means-clustering`

## Usage
Run the script with the command: `python main.py`
