# image k means clusting
 K-Means Clustering for Linear Algebra is a Python-based project that applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to image data. the project uses linear algebra concepts and libraries such as NumPy and PIL to process images into arrays. The K-Means clustering algorithm is then applied to categorize the data and update cluster centers. The centroids of the clusters are saved as images, providing a visual representation of the clustering results. This project offers a practical application of linear algebra concepts and the K-Means clustering algorithm in image processing
